            A remote world in the Outer Rim Territories, Abafar is scarcely populated. 
            It is dominated by vast stretches of featureless desert under oppressive 
            orange skies. The strange regolith that covers the surface twists light in such a 
            way as to obscure shadows and leave no tracks. Particulates in the atmosphere 
            cause the sunlight to diffuse into a uniform orange glow, so it is nearly 
            impossible to tell direction or time of day. The huge stretches of featureless 
            expanse are known as The Void. Pons Ora is one of the few settlements on Abafar, 
            and it is the site of a Rhydonium mining installation operated by the Separatists 
            during the Clone Wars.
